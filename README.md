# Description
This was my very first web apps assignment i had within the first year of studying computer science at Cardiff University.

# Instructions
## Web Page
Using only HTML and CSS, create a website consisting of at least three web pages dedicated to a person central to the development of computers or the Internet.
1. Each of the web pages should include a navigational menu that allows the user to move to each of the other pages on the website.
2. Include a table (with at least 2 columns and 3 rows) to provide a historical overview (e.g. year of birth, education, main achievements, and death if your website is about a person; years of main developments if your website is about a technology).
3. Include a picture, such that clicking on it brings the user to a related external page (for example to a Wikipedia page).
4. All pages of the website must be subject to CSS styling that is controlled by an external style sheet.

## Information within
If the website is about a particular person, then it should contain separate pages about:
1. Information about the person (e.g. his or her personal background).
2. A discussion about the technological contribution he or she has made.
3. A discussion on why this technological contribution is still relevant today
