         <h2>Personal life</h2>
         <p>
             Sergey Brin was born in Moscow, Russia in 1973. His parents were mathematicians and Jewish which limited their career opportunities in Russia, therefore in 1979 when Sergey was 6 years old, they emigrated to the United States escaping Jewish persecution.<br/>
             
             In 1993 at the age of 20, Brin graduated with a degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Maryland following his father and grandfather’s footsteps.<br/>
             
             In 1997 Sergey and Larry created the first search engine called BackRub. It was funded by the National Science Foundation. It was operating on the servers at the university of Stanford, until the servers couldn’t handle the bandwidth.<br/>
         
             In 1998 Sergey and Larry launched Google after raising $1 million, which became the most popular search engine in the world, receiving more than a trillion searches a day in 2016.
         </p><br/>
             
        <h2>Google’s Journey</h2>
            <p>In 1999 Google received $25 million from capital funding resulting in increasing the daily queries searched on the search engine to 500,000 per day.<br/>
            
            In 2004 users were accessing the website 200 million times a day, leading Google to issue its initial public offering (IPO), leaving Sergey Brin with a net of $3.8 billion.<br/>

            In 2006 Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion, which is known for being the most popular site for user submitted videos.<br/>

            In 2011 Sergey became the director of special projects.<br/>

            In 2015 Google got reorganised because of its huge projects and portfolio, creating a new parent company called Alphabet Inc with Sergey Brin being its president.
